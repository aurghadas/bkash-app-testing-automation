# 📱 bKash App Testing Automation

This program is built using **Python** and uses **Appium** as the testing framework. It automates the testing of different features in the **bKash Merchant Application**. The tests cover core functionalities like login, balance check, transactions, payments, and more.  

The test suite is designed to print both **success** and **failure** messages in the terminal to clearly determine test results. Each test outputs:  
✅ Specific messages for individual elements (e.g., button found, screen loaded).  
✅ A final summary message for each specific feature at the end of its execution.
